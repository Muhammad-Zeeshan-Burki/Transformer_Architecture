# Basic Transformer Implementation

This repository contains a **basic implementation of the Transformer model** provided in the Jupyter Notebook `basic_Transformer.ipynb`. The notebook is intended for educational purposes and demonstrates the core concepts behind the Transformer architecture in a clear and minimal way.

## 📄 File Description

- **basic_Transformer.ipynb**  
  A step-by-step implementation of a Transformer model, covering its main components such as:
  - Embedding layer
  - Positional encoding
  - Scaled dot-product attention
  - Multi-head attention
  - Feed-forward neural network
  - Encoder block structure

The notebook is designed to help students and beginners understand how Transformers work internally without relying heavily on high-level libraries.
